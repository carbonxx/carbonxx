Information Science student at [SCEM](https://www.sahyadri.edu.in/). Fascinated by everything that's CS related. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, and C++.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Web scraping Facebook bot.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to read, code and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
